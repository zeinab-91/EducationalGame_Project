Piano Educational Game Project

For the current repository, there are two executable files the one .exe in the .exe folder for windows and the other one for mac to run the application.

When running the game please don't change it to windowed or change the current screen resolution. Also to keep track with the game there will be red buttons on the top right with Q for questions or arrow for next.
