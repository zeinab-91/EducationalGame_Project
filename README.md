Piano Educational Game Project

For the current repository, there are two executable files the one .exe for windows and the other one for mac to run the application.

There is also a project folder, and that should be added in unity to run the whole project. Incase of mac in Unity open file, Build settings and change the target platform to mac and architecture to universal.

There is an assets folder inside the project that contains the scripts folder for direct investigating for the code.

When running the game please don't change it to windowed or change the current screen resolution. Also to keep track with the game there will be red buttons on the top right with Q for questions or arrow for next. I removed any stressing factors for more understandable application.
